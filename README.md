## How it works

Upon arrival on the page, you have a login form to have access to your dashboard looking like below

![Login page](./resource/login.png)

If you are yet to have an account then you can create an account. Your details are saved in a PostgreSQL database. 

![Signup page](./resource/signup.png)

Upon successfully login you can have access to your dashboard where you can add a record

![record adding](./resource/addRec.png)

Once a record is added it appears on the dashboard where you can see the details, edit and delete the records completely.
